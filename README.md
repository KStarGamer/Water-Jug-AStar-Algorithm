# Water-Jug-DFS-Algorithm
A Python script to generate a table, using the tabulate package, of the number of possible states of a jug puzzle determined by the three actions:

1) A jug is filled completely.
2) A jug is emptied completely.
3) The contents of a jug are poured into another jug until it is completely full, leaving any excess in the original jug.

The script has been written to support the volumes of up to 4 jugs, but can be easily modified to support more.
